Length of workshop: 2hr

About the workshop:

Cleaning your data can be a tedious and time-consuming task. This hands-on workshop will introduce you to the tidyverse syntax and explore some functions from the dplyr package to turn your data into the format you need. You will learn to select, filter, transform variables, pivot, make some basic descriptive analyses, and more in order to make your data wrangling more efficient.

* This workshop assumes you are familiar with R and the RStudio IDE. If you would like an intro to R, you can take advantage of this free course by R for the Rest of Us: https://rfortherestofus.com/courses/getting-started/

**I've spotted a mistake or would like to contribute**   
Please open a new issue. Better yet, please fork the repo and submit an upstream pull request. I'm very grateful for any contributions, but may be slow to respond (trying to get a doctorate done).

**Why are you doing this?**    
I am very excited for teaching and introducing people to R. I strongly believe that we do not have to reinvent the wheel if not necessary so collective work is important.

**What can you do to thank me?**     
This is a weird thing that someone asked me. I just would really appreciate it if you share it with your peers and also give credit where credit is due.
