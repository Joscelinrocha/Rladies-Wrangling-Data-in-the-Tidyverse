# Rladies-Wrangling-Data-in-the-Tidyverse
Materials for Tuesday, October 4, 2022 workshop: "Wrangling Data in the Tidyverse"

About the workshop:

Cleaning your data can be a tedious and time-consuming task. This hands-on workshop will introduce you to the tidyverse syntax and explore some functions from the dplyr package to turn your data into the format you need. You will learn to select, filter, transform variables, pivot, make some basic descriptive analyses, and more in order to make your data wrangling more efficient.

* This workshop assumes you are familiar with R and the RStudio IDE. If you would like an intro to R, you can take advantage of this free course by R for the Rest of Us: https://rfortherestofus.com/courses/getting-started/
